Image providing a reverse-proxy using [Nginx](http://nginx.org) HTTP server with support for HTTPS virtual hosts.

You can use this image as it is, or you can extend it and add configuration files for your virtual hosts.

## Automatic configuration ##

This image uses [docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) to dynamically generate Nginx configuration files
for containers exposing HTTP virtual hosts. This works automatically even across container restarts. You configure
virtual host by configuring environment variables on containers for which you want to provide a reverse proxy:
* `VIRTUAL_HOST` – a comma separated list of virtual hosts provided by the container
* `VIRTUAL_URL` – a comma separated list of URL paths provided by the container
* `VIRTUAL_PORT` – if container exposes more than one port, or you do not want to use the default port `80`, you can
configure a custom port to which a reverse proxy should connect on the container

When running a Docker image with your HTTP content, you can specify environment variables.

This will make the reverse proxy resolve `http://example.com/` into the `example` container:

```bash
docker run --name example ... --env VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com --env VIRTUAL_URL=/ ...
```

This will make the reverse proxy resolve `http://example.com/foo` into the `example1` container, but
This will make the reverse proxy resolve `http://example.com/bar` into the `example2` container.

```bash
docker run --name example1 ... --env VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com --env VIRTUAL_URL=/foo ...
docker run --name example2 ... --env VIRTUAL_HOST=example.com --env VIRTUAL_URL=/bar ...
```

Multiple containers can provide content for the same host and URL paths – Nginx will balance load across all of them.

### HTTPS ###

If you want to use HTTPS for a virtual host, you should mount a `/ssl` volume into the container and provide
SSL key for a virtual host.

For host `example.com` you should provide `/ssl/example.com.key` and `/ssl/example.com.crt`
files. Certificate file should contain the full chain needed to validate the certificate.
If those two files exist, the image will automatically configure the virtual host to use HTTPS and redirect any
non-HTTPS traffic to HTTPS.

If you want any extra configuration for non-HTTPS traffic, you can provide `/ssl/example.com_nonssl.conf` file which
will be included for the non-HTTPS configuration. Similarly, for extra configuration for the HTTPS site, provide
`/ssl/example.com_ssl.conf` file. Of course, filenames should match the hostname of your virtual host.

## Dynamic resolving of containers ##

If extending the image, you can put sites configuration files under `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` to add custom sites.

Alternatively, you can mount a volume into `/etc/nginx/sites-volume/` directory and provide sites there.

To support static configuration files for containers which have dynamic IP addresses, this image configures
Nginx with an internal lightweight DNS resolver which dynamically resolves container hostnames into IPs. Here
is an example of site configuration using DNS resolving:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    access_log /var/log/nginx/example.com_access.log;

    # We want to resolve container IPs dynamically, so we use a variable to make
    # Nginx resolve it again and again and not only at the start (so that it works
    # if containers change their IPs).

    location / {
        set $example example;
        proxy_pass http://$example:3000;
    }
}
```

This assumes that you have a container with hostname `example`:

```bash
docker run --name example --hostname example ...
```

By default, because of caching it can take up to 5 seconds for Nginx to start resolving a virtual host to a new
container IP address after a change.
